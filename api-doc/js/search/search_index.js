Started\nangular2-draggable has angular directives that make the DOM element draggable and resizable.\n\nngDraggable\n\nv2.x requires Angular >= 6\nv1.5.0 requires Angular >= 4 && \n\n\nngResizable\n\nprovided since v2.0, requires Angular >= 6\n\n\n\nLatest Update\n\n2019.08.01: 1.5.0:\n\nngDraggable: \nPorting features from v2 to v1\n\n\n\n\n2019.06.10: 2.3.2:\n\nngResizable\nFix issue #164: Resize doesn't work on Windows10 IE11 (PR #171 by shumih, PR #174 by LiorSaadon)\n\n\n\n\n2019.05.14: 2.3.0:\n\nngResizable:\n\nFix issue #157: Problem resizing with containment\nAdd direction property in IResizeEvent. \n\n\nngDraggable: \n\nAdd CSS class ng-dragging when dragging.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\nnpm install angular2-draggable --saveDraggable\nPlease refer to the demo page.\n\nFirstly, import AngularDraggableModule in your app module (or any other proper angular module):\n import { AngularDraggableModule } from 'angular2-draggable';\n\n @NgModule({\n   imports: [\n     ...,\n     AngularDraggableModule\n   ],\n   ...\n })\n export class AppModule { }\nThen: use ngDraggable directive to make the DOM element draggable.\n\nSimple example:\n\nhtml:Drag me!\n\n\nUse [handle] to move parent element:\n\nhtml:\nI'm handle. Drag me!\nYou can't drag this block now!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResizable\nPlease refer to the demo page.\nBesides of importing AngularDraggableModule, you need to import resizable.min.css in your project. If you use angular-cli, you can add this in angular.json:\n\"styles\": [\n    ...\n+   \"node_modules/angular2-draggable/css/resizable.min.css\"\n]Then you can use ngResizable directive to make the element resizable:\n I'm now resizable \n\n Resizable is disabled now \n\n Each side is resizable Well you can use both directives concurrently if you wish:\n I'm now draggable and resizable API\nDirective:\n\nngDraggable directive support following input porperties:\n\n\n\nInput\nType\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nngDraggable\nboolean\ntrue\nYou can toggle the draggable capability by setting true or false\n\n\nhandle\nHTMLElement\nnull\nUse template variable to refer to the handle element. Then only the handle element is draggable\n\n\nzIndex\nstring\nnull\nUse it to set z-index property when element is not moving\n\n\nzIndexMoving\nstring\nnull\nUse it to set z-index property when element is moving\n\n\nbounds\nHTMLElemnt\nnull\nUse it to set the boundary\n\n\ninBounds\nboolean\nfalse\nUse it make element stay in the bounds\n\n\noutOfBounds\n{ top: boolean; bottom: boolean; right: boolean; left: boolean }\nfalse\nSet it to allow element get out of bounds from the direction. Refer to demo\n\n\nposition\n{ x: number, y: number }\n{ x:0, y:0 }\nUse it to set position offset\n\n\ngridSize\nnumber\n1\nUse it for snapping to grid. Refer to demo\n\n\npreventDefaultEvent\nboolean\nfalse\nWhether to prevent default mouse event\n\n\nscale\nnumber\n1\nSet it when parent element has CSS transform scale\n\n\nlockAxis\n'x' | 'y'\nnull\nRestrict dragging to a specific axis by locking another one\n\n\n\n\nngResizable directive support following input porperties:\n\n\n\nInput\nType\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nngResizable\nboolean\ntrue\nYou can toggle the resizable capability by setting true or false\n\n\nrzHandles\nstring\n\"e,s,se\"\nWhich handles can be used for resizing. Optional types in \"n,e,s,w,se,sw,ne,nw\" or \"all\"\n\n\nrzAspectRatio\nboolean | number\nfalse\nboolean: Whether the element should be constrained to a specific aspect ratio. number: Force the element to maintain a specific aspect ratio during resizing (width/height)\n\n\nrzContainment\nSelector | string | Element\nnull\nConstrains resizing to within the bounds of the specified element or region. It accepts an HTMLElement, 'parent' or a valid CSS selector string such as '#id'\n\n\nrzGrid\nnumber | number[]\n1\nSnaps the resizing element to a grid, every x and y pixels. Array values: [x, y]\n\n\nrzMinWidth\nnumber\n1\nThe minimum width the resizable should be allowed to resize to.\n\n\nrzMaxWidth\nnumber\n1\nThe maximum width the resizable should be allowed to resize to.\n\n\nrzMinHeight\nnumber\n1\nThe minimum height the resizable should be allowed to resize to.\n\n\nrzMaxHeight\nnumber\n1\nThe maximum height the resizable should be allowed to resize to.\n\n\npreventDefaultEvent\nboolean\nfalse\nWhether to prevent default mouse event.\n\n\n\n\n\nCSS:\n\nWhen ngDraggable is enabled on some element, ng-draggable and ng-dragging class is automatically toggled on it. You can use it to customize the pointer style. For example:\n  .ng-draggable {\n    cursor: grab;\n  }\n\n  .ng-dragging {\n    cursor: grabbing;\n  }\nWhen ngResizable is enabled on some element, ng-resizable class is automatically assigned to it. And handle elements will be created with ng-resizable-handle. You can customize the handle style.\n\n\nEvents\n\nngDraggable directive:\n\n\n\nOutput\n$event\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nstarted\nnativeElement of host\nemitted when start dragging\n\n\nstopped\nnativeElement of host\nemitted when stop dragging\n\n\nedge\n{ top: boolean, right: boolean, bottom: boolean, left: boolean }\nemitted after [bounds] is set\n\n\nmovingOffset\n{ x: number, y: number }\nemit position offset when moving\n\n\nendOffset\n{ x: number, y: number }\nemit position offset when stop moving\n\n\n\n  Simple example:\n  \n    Drag me!\n  \nngResizable directive:\n\n\n\nOutput\n$event\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nrzStart\nIResizeEvent\nemitted when start resizing\n\n\nrzResizing\nIResizeEvent\nemitted when resizing\n\n\nrzStop\nIResizeEvent\nemitted when stop resizing\n\n\n\n  export interface IResizeEvent {\n    host: any;\n    handle: any;\n    size: {\n      width: number;\n      height: number;\n    };\n    position: {\n      top: number;\n      left: number;\n    };\n    direction: {\n      n: boolean;\n      s: boolean;\n      w: boolean;\n      e: boolean;\n    };\n  }  Simple example:\n  \n    Resizable\n  \n\nDemo\nYou can clone this repo to your working copy and then launch the demo page in your local machine:\nnpm install\nnpm run demo\n\n# or\nyarn install\nyarn demoThe demo page server is listening to: http://localhost:4203\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2017 Xie, Ziyu\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
